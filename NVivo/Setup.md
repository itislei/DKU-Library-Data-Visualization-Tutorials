# **Downloading, Installing and Licensing NVivo 14**

This guide provides instructions for requesting, downloading, installing, and activating an NVivo 14 license using your NetID. NVivo is a qualitative data analysis software compatible with Windows and Mac.

Please note that Collaboration Cloud, Transcription, and the AI Assistant (available only in NVivo 15) are not included in our institutional license. If you require these features, you will need to purchase them independently or explore alternative solutions.
