## Key Topics Covered

### Survey Questions (FG1/FG2):
- **Role & Scope**: Involvement in purchasing/maintenance decisions, number of data centers managed.
- **Facility Characteristics**: Size, rack count, server count, sectors supported, locations.
- **Upgrade Cycles**: Frequency of server replacement, infrastructure upgrades.
- **Energy Monitoring**: Tracking of energy use, PUE, server utilization.
- **Leasing & Outsourcing**: Renting/leasing space, equipment, facility management.
- **Technology Adoption**: Use of efficiency strategies (cold/hot aisle containment, economizers, virtualization, etc.).
- **Pricing Models**: For multi-tenant data centers (space-based, power-based pricing).

### Interview Themes
- **Decision Factors**: Energy efficiency, uptime, cost, location, connectivity, client demand.
- **Technology Evaluation**: Vendor relations, in-house testing, peer feedback, ROI calculations.
- **Barriers & Trade-offs**: Reliability vs. efficiency, climate constraints, financing, tenant contracts.
